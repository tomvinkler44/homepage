      "After submitting over 300 applications resulting in one interview (which lled nowhere), I was ready to give up. This system helped me completely revamp my approach. Within 4 weeks, I had 5 interviews lined up, and two of them actually led to offers. Google was the obvious choice ðŸ™‚  The interview practices really helped, I think my resume also became a lot better after a few rounds with Hirelloâ€™s AI.",

      "I was stuck in an endless cycle of applying through job boards and hearing nothing back. Following this program I was able to figure out how to build connections and eventually one of these turned into a referral, which turned into an interview, then an offer. The outreach templates and hidden job market strategies led to conversations that never would have happened otherwise. I think without Hirelloâ€™s system I would still be submitting applications after application.",

      "After 8 months of frustrating job searching and one failed interview after another, I didnâ€™t know how to keep the hope alive. But the 30 day program made a lot of sense, I tried to follow it best I could. And the structured interview prep made a big difference. I went from constant rejections to passing 3 second round interviews and finally one job offer.",
